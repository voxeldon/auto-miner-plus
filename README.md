## Auto-Miner Manager
A new item, the Auto-Miner Manager, allows players to oversee their fleet of Auto-Miners with a series of convenient options:

### Pilot Auto-Miner
Players can now pilot their Auto-Miners. When activated, the player's camera switches to the selected Auto-Miner’s point of view, enabling rotation and control to start or stop it.

### Recall
Recall a specific Auto-Miner to your location.

### Teleport To  
Teleport to an Auto-Miner's location. When used again, this feature provides an option to return to your original location.

## Auto-Pump
The Auto-Pump transfers inventory items from paired Auto-Miners to the pump’s location every tick.
